# About

Hello! My name is Caleb Vredevoogd and I am a Computer Science student at
Calvin University. My coursework has covered a wide range of software development experience from full stack application development to writing low-level code and scripts for embedded systems. Most of my professional and research experience has involved writing for embedded Linux using both Python and C.

Personally, I enjoy coding in Python for its simplicity. I've also been using Linux for most of my personal computing. Recently it's been my go-to system for daily driving and has worked pretty well so far apart from the occasional compatibility issues with certain applications. Most of my experience has been with some flavor of Debian or Ubuntu, that currently being [Pop! OS by System 76](https://pop.system76.com/).

This blog will host updates on current projects as well as maybe some reviews. I've been doing a bit of book reading, game playing, movie watching and music listening, so depending on how active I am on this blog you'll see more posts about that as well. I have only a couple of posts right now, but hopefully more will come.
